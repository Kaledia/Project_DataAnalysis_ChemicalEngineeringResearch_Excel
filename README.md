# Project_DataAnalysis_ChemicalEngineeringResearch_Excel
Project performed during my class of Statistical Principles in Engineering at Lamar University for the Master in Chemical Engineering in Spring 2018
Teacher: Dr Xinyu Liu, Associate Professor

We answered the following questions during this project:
1. Do the results prove that algae absorb a significant amount of photon?
2. The results are not the same for the different positions as they should be. Can you prove that these values are close enough? If not, determine positions or values are very far from average, to exclude these positions in future experiments.
3. The values of absorption of photon to be exploited, must be greater than the limit of 80    μmol.s-1m-2 . Is that the case?  
4. Some additional experiments were done to compare the impact of day length on photon absorption of culture. The cultures were exposed to different cycles of light and dark (08:16 hours, 10:14h, 12:12h, 14:10h and 16:8h). How does the day length impact the capacity of absorption of algae?     

The tools we used to answer these 4 questions are: 
For question 1: Confidence intervals on the difference between 2 means (to compare the measurements of photon flux in water and in culture).
For question 2: Box plot (to determine outliers). 
For question 3: Hypothesis testing for one variable.
For question 4: Simple linear regression.
